I am a Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. I am a member of the GIST research section and within that, I lead the Multimodal Interaction Group doing world-leading research in human-computer interaction (mig.dcs.gla.ac.uk). My research focuses on multimodal HCI, or using multiple sensory modalities and control mechanisms (particularly audio, haptics and gesture) to create a rich, natural interaction between human and computer. My work has a strong experimental focus, applying perceptual research to practical situations. I currently hold and ERC Advanced Grant on virtual and augmented reality (the ViAjeRo project). I also work on interfaces for mobile devices and in-car interactions.

I am a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a member of the ACM SIGCHI Academy and an ACM Distinguished Speaker.
